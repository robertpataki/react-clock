# React Clock Component

A simple React Clock made with [React CDK](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-cdk).

## TO DO

- Use stroke on the face element for bezel instead of an extra filled circle
- Add visibility flag to custom themes (so that certain elements can be hidden)
- Use RAD instead of setInterval
- TODO - See if there is a way to test the timer being stopped on unmount
